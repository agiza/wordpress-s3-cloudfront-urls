S3/CloudFront Upload Tool
=========================

WordPress plugin specifically for uploading to S3 for the purpose of generating CloudFront Links. 

Description
-----------

This tool was created specifically for uploading files to S3 for the purpose of generating CloudFront links. Additionally, because it uses the AWS Javascript SDK, all interations with AWS are done client-side, with no server storage necessary. Optionally, if you use the Qloudstat metrics service, you can connect it to their API to get your download numbers. 

TODOs
